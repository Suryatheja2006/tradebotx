# TradeBotX — SoC '25 @ WNCC IIT Bombay

Welcome to the official repository for **TradeBotX**, a Summer of Code 2025 project conducted by [WNCC, IIT Bombay](https://wncc-iitb.org/). This initiative aims to bridge two powerful domains — finance and machine learning — through hands-on, data-driven exploration.

**Mentors:** Surya Theja, Sujay, Chandrashen

## 🧭 Project Overview

This 8-week program introduces participants to the world of financial markets, algorithmic trading, and the application of ML models to develop and optimize trading strategies. From building basic intuition about market mechanics to implementing data pipelines and predictive models, the journey is designed to be both educational and exploratory.

The goal is not just to learn finance or ML separately, but to **build practical systems that combine the two** — and understand the *why* behind every decision.

## 📚 Resources 

This GitHub repository will serve as the primary source of resources for this project. It will be updated periodically as the project progresses, and you’ll be notified of any changes. Feel free to reach out with questions or explore additional resources on your own as needed.

Note: Don’t feel like you need to go through 100% of the material – it’s not all equally important. Focus on what seems useful or interesting, and try to cover the key ideas. You’re also encouraged to explore more on your own or reach out to us if you get stuck or want to dig deeper.

We’re also always open to feedback – if something’s unclear or boring or too much, just say so.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suryatheja2006/TradeBotX.git
cd tradebotx
```

## 🧠 Why This Project?
Most people view finance and ML in isolation or via buzzwords. This project encourages you to ask questions like:

- Why does a trading strategy work?

- What features really drive market behavior?

- Can a simple ML model outperform a handcrafted rule?

Expect to **think critically**, **experiment freely**, and **collaborate actively**.

We hope to get to know you better along the process and guide you accordingly.

## 👨‍🏫 Mentors
- Surya Theja — Quant/ML/Markets Enthusiast

- Sujay — Systems & Strategy Curious

- Chandrashen — Data Nerd | Loves risk & probability

We won’t spoon-feed, but we’re here to help you think deeper.

Feel free to ask questions or share feedback directly in the group — nothing’s too basic. And if you’re more comfortable, you can always DM me or any of the other mentors anytime.
