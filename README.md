# TradeBotX — SoC '25 @ WNCC IIT Bombay

Welcome to the official repository for **TradeBotX**, a Summer of Code 2025 project conducted by [WNCC, IIT Bombay](https://wncc-iitb.org/). This initiative aims to bridge two powerful domains — finance and machine learning — through hands-on, data-driven exploration.

**Mentors:** Surya Theja, Sujay, Chandrashen

## 🧭 Project Overview

This 8-week program introduces participants to the world of financial markets, algorithmic trading, and the application of ML models to develop and optimize trading strategies. From building basic intuition about market mechanics to implementing data pipelines and predictive models, the journey is designed to be both educational and exploratory.

The goal is not just to learn finance or ML separately, but to **build practical systems that combine the two** — and understand the *why* behind every decision.
