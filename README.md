# TradeBotX — SoC '25 @ WNCC IIT Bombay

Welcome to the official repository for **TradeBotX**, a Summer of Code 2025 project conducted by [WNCC, IIT Bombay](https://wncc-iitb.org/). This initiative aims to bridge two powerful domains — finance and machine learning — through hands-on, data-driven exploration.

**Mentors:** Surya Theja, Sujay, Chandrashen

## 🧭 Project Overview

This 8-week program introduces participants to the world of financial markets, algorithmic trading, and the application of ML models to develop and optimize trading strategies. From building basic intuition about market mechanics to implementing data pipelines and predictive models, the journey is designed to be both educational and exploratory.

The goal is not just to learn finance or ML separately, but to **build practical systems that combine the two** — and understand the *why* behind every decision.

- 📊 Perform data cleaning and visual analysis
- 🤖 Train & evaluate ML models on market data
- ⚙️ Use APIs to simulate real-time trading
- 🧠 Build a capstone trading strategy and YOLO your (virtual) life savings

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming
- Enthusiasm to explore finance through a computational lens
- No prior trading experience required — just curiosity

## 📚 Resources 

This GitHub repository will serve as the primary source of resources for this project. You're encouraged to reach out with questions or explore additional materials online as needed.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suryatheja2006/TradeBotX.git
cd tradebotx
```

## 🧠 Why This Project?
Most people view finance and ML in isolation or via buzzwords. This project encourages you to ask questions like:

- Why does a trading strategy work?

- What features really drive market behavior?

- Can a simple ML model outperform a handcrafted rule?

Expect to **think critically**, **experiment freely**, and **collaborate actively**.

We hope to get to know you better along the process and guide you accordingly.
